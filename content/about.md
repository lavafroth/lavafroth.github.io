Hi, this is Himadri. I'm a self taught programmer and a digital artist.
You might have arrived here from [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@lavafroth) or my open source work.
I'm doing a bachelors in data science at IITM.

I'm decent with programming languages like C and Java, the latter of which was
taught in school. I'm *great* at writing Golang and Rust. I render my YouTube
videos with Python and the manim framework, so I'd argue I'm competent at it
as well.

I have been daily driving various Linux distributions since 2016. For the past few years,
I have settled with NixOS. It is stable enough, incredibly versatile
and lets me declaratively configure all my setups.

Most of my work is open source and under the public domain. If you find value in them,
consider contributing to them or donating.

Thank you to all the institutions and non-profit
organizations such as [Khan Academy](https://khanacademy.org),
who provide [OpenCourseWare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare) and make education accessible.

## Certifications

Petty things recruiters seem to care about.
