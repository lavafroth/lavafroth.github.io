> Note: The following interactive animation requires JavaScript to render. Please enable it if it isn't already.

A live, in-browser demo of `PROJECT_MANA`.

Feel free to look around: rotate, zoom or pan the 3D view.

Frames for the outline animation will be recomputed on the fly! The hardcoded duration for the animation
is 5 seconds in this example.

{{< rawhtml "content/post/project_mana.html" >}}

Try toggling the theme switcher: the sun or moon icon up in the header.
