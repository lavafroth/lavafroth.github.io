This is my first time trying out sculpting in blender, so forgive me for the
quality of the sculpt. I'm still pretty much in the learning stage. Big thank
you to [Nichole Sebastian](https://www.pexels.com/@nichole-sebastian-1592975/)
for the reference photo. Also apologies if the empty eye sockets gave you a
jumpscare.
