# AQ2.1
1. \( O(n^2) \)
2. \( O(n\ log\ n) \)
3. \( O(n^3) \)
4. \( O(n + log\ m) \)
5. \( O(log\ n) \)
6. \( O(n^2\ log\ n) \)

# AQ2.2

1. \( O(log\ n) \)
2. 5
3. 3
4. 3
5. 2
6. Multiple options:
   - It works only on sorted arrays.
   - It has a best-case time complexity of O(1).

# AQ2.3

> Selection sort always makes n(n-1)/2 comparisons which is of order \( O(n^2) \)

1. 3
2. 15
3. 45
4. Multiple options:
   - [4, 4, 3, 5, 6]
   - [7, 2, 8, 7, 3]
   - [9, 1, 4, 9, 5]
5. Multiple options:
   - It is an in-place algorithm.
   - It performs \( O(n^2) \) comparisons in the worst case.
6. \( \lceil{n/2}\rceil \) In this case, you narrow the window of comparison on both sides by 1

6. `array[j] > key â†’ array[j] < key`
7. \( O(n) \)

# AQ2.5

> Merging two sorted lists of size \(m\) and \(n\) takes worst case \(m + n - 1\) comparisons

1. 14
2. To combine two sorted sublists into a single sorted list.
3. Multiple options:
   - It is a divide-and-conquer algorithm
   - It requires additional space proportional to the size of the input list.
   - It is stable.
4. 4
5. \(T(n) = 2T(n/2) + n\)
6. 6
7. Merge Sort has the same time complexity \( O(n\ log\ n) \) for best, worst, and average cases.
