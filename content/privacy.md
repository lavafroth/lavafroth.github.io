This site does NOT use cookies or third party analytics to track you.
All resources that are served, including fonts, styles and scripts are local and not sourced from CDNs.
Client side local storage is only used to store the setting for the light or dark theme.

The posts here can be viewed regardless of whether javascript is enabled.
The only features relying on javascript are the theme switcher (try clicking the sun or moon icon) and the search box.
