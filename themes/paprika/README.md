# Heads Up!

Paprika is a heavily modified version of the
[Paper](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-paper/) theme to suit my blog's aesthetics.
Attempting to use the theme on your blog as is will likely break it.

If you still wish to proceed using this theme, make sure to have a basic
understanding of [Hugo templates](https://gohugo.io/templates/introduction/).
