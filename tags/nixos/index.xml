CUDA, also known as Compute Unified Device Architecture
is a proprietary parallel computing platform and application programming interface that allows software to use certain types of graphics processing units for accelerated general-purpose processing, an approach called general-purpose computing on GPUs.
according to Wikipedia.
According to me, it is a proprietary vendor lock-in for machine learning folks and the bane of my existence. There&amp;rsquo;s no other API out there that competes with CUDA as of writing.</description></item><item><title>Using an Android Phone as a webcam in NixOS</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/android-phone-for-webcam-nixos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 08:47:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/android-phone-for-webcam-nixos/</guid><description>I recently had to attend an online meeting for a software development event. While my PC did have a decent microphone, the built-in camera has been damaged to the extent that the best it can capture is this:
No, it&amp;rsquo;s not a close-up of the moon, it&amp;rsquo;s the refraction caused by the scuffs to the lens plus other sciency stuff I&amp;rsquo;m not qualified enough to explain to you.
I was aware that one can use ADB to use an Android phone&amp;rsquo;s camera as a makeshift webcam.</description></item><item><title>I Switched to NixOS</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/i-switched-to-nixos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 09:29:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/i-switched-to-nixos/</guid><description>Hi. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since I had last posted. I had been spending my time on some programming projects that withheld me from even participating in CTFs. Tired of this workflow that I somehow spiraled into, I&amp;rsquo;m now seeking to learn new things in an attempt to break out of this workflow.
The End of an Overarching Journey As any of my long time audience might be familiar with, I daily drove Arch Linux.</description></item></channel></rss>
