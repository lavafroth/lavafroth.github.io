Since it&amp;rsquo;s not obvious from the landing page of my blog, my name is Himadri Bhattacharjee. I am from India. I graduated high school in early 2022. Over the past two years, I have applied to multiple colleges including but not limited to Harvard, MIT and Stanford. I did so because I believed that my academics in school would meet the expectations of such institutions.
My extra curricular activities felt good enough to complement my applications.</description></item><item><title>Abstracting Structured Patterns in Concurrent Programming</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/abstracting-structured-patterns-in-concurrent-programming/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 10:58:10 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/abstracting-structured-patterns-in-concurrent-programming/</guid><description>I hope this article provides a solid blueprint for building a concurrency management API.

It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since I had last posted. I had been spending my time on some programming projects that withheld me from even participating in CTFs. Tired of this workflow that I somehow spiraled into, I&amp;rsquo;m now seeking to learn new things in an attempt to break out of this workflow.
The End of an Overarching Journey As any of my long time audience might be familiar with, I daily drove Arch Linux.</description></item></channel></rss>
