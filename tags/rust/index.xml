Quite a few months have passed since I last posted here. As you might have known from my earlier posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve been daily driving Wayland instead of Xorg on my NixOS setup for quite some time now.
One of the tools I stumbled upon while writing my voice automation abomination was SWHKD (Simple Wayland HotKey Daemon). It&amp;rsquo;s a spiritual successor to sxhkd from the Xorg world and in a sense better than the former because it works not only in wayland sessions but also under X and TTY sessions!</description></item><item><title>Abstracting Structured Patterns in Concurrent Programming</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/abstracting-structured-patterns-in-concurrent-programming/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 Dec 2023 10:58:10 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/abstracting-structured-patterns-in-concurrent-programming/</guid><description>I hope this article provides a solid blueprint for building a concurrency management API. If you have questions or feel that I have missed something, feel free to talk about it in this repository&amp;rsquo;s issue tracker or the discussion board.
In recent months, I have come across multiple articles talking about the need of structured concurrency in modern programming languages as a built-in. Notably, in the article Notes on structured concurrency, or: Go statement considered harmful, the author compares the go statement used to spawn coroutines to goto statements used for jumping to other parts of code in early languages like COBOL.</description></item><item><title>Pixelated</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/picoctf-cryptography-pixelated/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 09:25:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/picoctf-cryptography-pixelated/</guid><description>This challenge gives use two images and asks us if we can make a flag out of them. At first glance, both the images look like noise. Upon a quick web lookup of visual cryptography, it appears that these separate images, known as shares of the original image, can be overlayed on each other to reconstruct the original image.
Exploration Now, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that there are online services that will automatically solve these but I decided to write some code to solve this locally.</description></item></channel></rss>
