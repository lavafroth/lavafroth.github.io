If you have questions or feel that I have missed something, feel free to talk about it in this repository&amp;rsquo;s issue tracker or the discussion board.
In recent months, I have come across multiple articles talking about the need of structured concurrency in modern programming languages as a builtin, replacing or at the very least, drastically enhancing the current paradigms like async-await.</description></item><item><title>Pixelated</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/picoctf-cryptography-pixelated/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 09:25:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/picoctf-cryptography-pixelated/</guid><description>This challenge gives use two images and asks us if we can make a flag out of them. At first glance, both the images look like noise. Upon a quick web lookup of visual cryptography, it appears that these separate images, known as shares of the original image, can be overlayed on each other to reconstruct the original image.
Exploration Now, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that there are online services that will automatically solve these but I decided to write some code to solve this locally.</description></item></channel></rss>
