In the article Notes on structured concurrency, or: Go statement considered harmful, the author compares the go statement used to spawn coroutines to goto statements used for jumping to other parts of code in early languages like COBOL.</description></item><item><title>Pixelated</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/picoctf-cryptography-pixelated/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2022 09:25:20 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/picoctf-cryptography-pixelated/</guid><description>This challenge gives use two images and asks us if we can make a flag out of them. At first glance, both the images look like noise. Upon a quick web lookup of visual cryptography, it appears that these separate images, known as shares of the original image, can be overlayed on each other to reconstruct the original image.
Exploration Now, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure that there are online services that will automatically solve these but I decided to write some code to solve this locally.</description></item></channel></rss>
