Each post covers a separate topic. While the previous posts might have given you an overview of ideas, this post will delve into more technical details. I highly recommend reading the previous posts because I will refer to them from time to time.
Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with why we chose EBNF grammar in pest.rs instead of regular expressions.</description></item><item><title>A SWEET Little Parser</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/a-sweet-little-config-parser/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 07:52:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/a-sweet-little-config-parser/</guid><description>A few days ago, I had announced my project for this year&amp;rsquo;s Google Summer of Code. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll be explanding upon that. I believe that to construct a good grammar, I should be able to understand and explain it well. So here goes.
General Idea SWHKD&amp;rsquo;s grammar parser, although similar to tools before it like sxhkd, has a more coherent syntax. For starters, every binding declaration is one or more accelerators followed by a composite key.</description></item><item><title>Wayland Tools Rock!</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/wayland-tools-rock/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 07:52:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/wayland-tools-rock/</guid><description>Hey folks. Quite a few months have passed since I last posted here. As you might have known from my earlier posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve been daily driving Wayland instead of Xorg on my NixOS setup for quite some time now.
One of the tools I stumbled upon while writing my voice automation abomination was SWHKD (Simple Wayland HotKey Daemon). It&amp;rsquo;s a spiritual successor to sxhkd from the Xorg world and in a sense better than the former because it works not only in wayland sessions but also under X and TTY sessions!</description></item></channel></rss>
