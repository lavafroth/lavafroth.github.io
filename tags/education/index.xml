Since it&amp;rsquo;s not obvious from the landing page of my blog, my name is Himadri Bhattacharjee. I am from India. I graduated high school in early 2022. Over the past two years, I have applied to multiple colleges including but not limited to Harvard, MIT and Stanford. I did so because I believed that my academics in school would meet the expectations of such institutions.
My extra curricular activities felt good enough to complement my applications.</description></item></channel></rss>
