The general distinction for these two types involves modifier keys. When I talk about a shortcut bound to super v, chances are you automatically think of global bindings at the operating system or desktop environment level. Today we&amp;rsquo;ll go through the process of writing the grammar for these bindings for swhkd.</description></item><item><title>Edge cases?

I highly recommend reading through the previous posts as I&amp;rsquo;ll be referring to them from time to time.
In the last post I talked about key attributes that can be used as prefix to denote the timing of an event, on key press (send / ~) or release (on_release / @).</description></item><item><title>Timing is Key: A Tale of Keystrokes and Timings</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/timing-is-key/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 May 2024 21:18:22 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/timing-is-key/</guid><description>Whether you&amp;rsquo;re playing a video game or competing in a constrained attack-defense CTF, your keystroke timings matter. We at waycrate value your precision, to the extent that you can configure your keybindings to perform actions either on a key&amp;rsquo;s press or a release.
Hi, my name&amp;rsquo;s Himadri and this post is a part of a series explaining how we (basically just me) are rewriting the config parser for swhkd using EBNF grammar.</description></item><item><title>Keep the Keys Clackin'</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/keep-the-keys-clackin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 May 2024 08:59:29 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/keep-the-keys-clackin/</guid><description>This is the second post in a series of posts I&amp;rsquo;m writing for Google Summer of Code. Each post covers a separate topic. While the previous posts might have given you an overview of ideas, this post will delve into more technical details. I highly recommend reading the previous posts because I will refer to them from time to time.
Let&amp;rsquo;s begin with why we chose EBNF grammar in pest.rs instead of regular expressions.</description></item><item><title>A SWEET Little Parser</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/a-sweet-little-config-parser/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 07:52:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/a-sweet-little-config-parser/</guid><description>A few days ago, I had announced my project for this year&amp;rsquo;s Google Summer of Code. Today I&amp;rsquo;ll be explanding upon that. I believe that to construct a good grammar, I should be able to understand and explain it well. So here goes.
General Idea SWHKD&amp;rsquo;s grammar parser, although similar to tools before it like sxhkd, has a more coherent syntax. For starters, every binding declaration is one or more accelerators followed by a composite key.</description></item><item><title>Wayland Tools Rock!</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/wayland-tools-rock/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 May 2024 07:52:44 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/wayland-tools-rock/</guid><description>Hey folks. Quite a few months have passed since I last posted here. As you might have known from my earlier posts, I&amp;rsquo;ve been daily driving Wayland instead of Xorg on my NixOS setup for quite some time now.
One of the tools I stumbled upon while writing my voice automation abomination was SWHKD (Simple Wayland HotKey Daemon). It&amp;rsquo;s a spiritual successor to sxhkd from the Xorg world and in a sense better than the former because it works not only in wayland sessions but also under X and TTY sessions!</description></item></channel></rss>
