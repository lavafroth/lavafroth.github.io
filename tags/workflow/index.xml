Although it came preinstalled with Windows, I never let it even boot and instead opted for linux. Bill Gates can cry a river.
Over the years, I had switched distros multiple times but one sporadic issue that almost always put me in an inconvenience was the wireless card dying after a few minutes of booting the box.</description></item><item><title>Using an Android Phone as a webcam in NixOS</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/android-phone-for-webcam-nixos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 08:47:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/android-phone-for-webcam-nixos/</guid><description>I recently had to attend an online meeting for a software development event.

It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since I had last posted. I had been spending my time on some programming projects that withheld me from even participating in CTFs. Tired of this workflow that I somehow spiraled into, I&amp;rsquo;m now seeking to learn new things in an attempt to break out of this workflow.
