CUDA, also known as Compute Unified Device Architecture
is a proprietary parallel computing platform and application programming interface that allows software to use certain types of graphics processing units for accelerated general-purpose processing, an approach called general-purpose computing on GPUs.
according to Wikipedia.
According to me, it is a proprietary vendor lock-in for machine learning folks and the bane of my existence. There&amp;rsquo;s no other API out there that competes with CUDA as of writing.</description></item><item><title>How I Use SWHKD in My Workflow</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/how-i-use-swhkd-in-my-workflow/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Aug 2024 17:17:31 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/how-i-use-swhkd-in-my-workflow/</guid><description>SWHKD is the project that I have been working on for the past few months as a part of Google Summer of Code for this year. Now that we are done with the development process, I want to talk about why I wanted to improve the project. Although the easy answer is to get paid or to get a more production facing OSS development experience, for me, the most important driving force is using it in my own workflow.</description></item><item><title>I Solemnly Swear to Never Buy a Gaming Laptop Again</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/i-solemnly-swear-to-never-buy-a-gaming-laptop-again/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2024 17:01:01 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/i-solemnly-swear-to-never-buy-a-gaming-laptop-again/</guid><description>Around half a decade ago, I bought an Asus gaming laptop, one I&amp;rsquo;m currently using to write this article. Although it came preinstalled with Windows, I never let it even boot and instead opted for linux. Bill Gates can cry a river.
Despite switching distros multiple times, one sporadical issue my setup suffered from was the wireless card dying after a few minutes of booting the box. The only solution to this was to reboot my computer, classic!</description></item><item><title>Using an Android Phone as a webcam in NixOS</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/android-phone-for-webcam-nixos/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Mar 2024 08:47:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/android-phone-for-webcam-nixos/</guid><description>I recently had to attend an online meeting for a software development event. While my PC did have a decent microphone, the built-in camera has been damaged to the extent that the best it can capture is this:
No, it&amp;rsquo;s not a close-up of the moon, it&amp;rsquo;s the refraction caused by the scuffs to the lens plus other sciency stuff I&amp;rsquo;m not qualified enough to explain to you.
I was aware that one can use ADB to use an Android phone&amp;rsquo;s camera as a makeshift webcam.</description></item><item><title>I Switched to NixOS</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/i-switched-to-nixos/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Jul 2023 09:29:34 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/i-switched-to-nixos/</guid><description>Hi. It&amp;rsquo;s been quite a while since I had last posted. I had been spending my time on some programming projects that withheld me from even participating in CTFs. Tired of this workflow that I somehow spiraled into, I&amp;rsquo;m now seeking to learn new things in an attempt to break out of this workflow.
The End of an Overarching Journey As any of my long time audience might be familiar with, I daily drove Arch Linux.</description></item><item><title>Liberating 14GiB of disk space</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/liberating-14gib-of-space/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 13:15:26 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/liberating-14gib-of-space/</guid><description>The idea is simple:
Remove all duplicates, including zero length files Fine tuning: Hand-pick and remove files deemed unnecessary Since the mileage for second step might vary from person to person, I&amp;rsquo;ll elaborate on the first step.
I chose jdupes as my weapon of choice for finding and removing the duplicates. It&amp;rsquo;s free and open-source and is cross platform.
For a given folder we would run the following to wipe the duplicates:</description></item></channel></rss>
