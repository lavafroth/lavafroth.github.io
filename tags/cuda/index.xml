CUDA, also known as Compute Unified Device Architecture
is a proprietary parallel computing platform and application programming interface that allows software to use certain types of graphics processing units for accelerated general-purpose processing, an approach called general-purpose computing on GPUs.
according to Wikipedia.
According to me, it is a proprietary vendor lock-in for machine learning folks and the bane of my existence. There&amp;rsquo;s no other API out there that competes with CUDA as of writing.</description></item><item><title>The Make Everything Ok Button</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/the-make-everything-ok-button/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2022 09:20:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/the-make-everything-ok-button/</guid><description>Disclaimer Before I begin, I must warn you that DeepFaceLab is just a tool, neither good nor evil. Neither Deepfacelab nor the docker image is meant for generating illicit or obscene imagery. You shall be solely liable for anything you do with these tools.
You know the drill Everytime I have to install DeepFaceLab on any of my systems, it comes with a lot of hassle mostly due to incompatibilities between the GPU libraries and Python versions.</description></item></channel></rss>
