CUDA is a proprietary vendor lock-in for machine learning folks. Training ML models is incredibly fast with CUDA as compared to CPUs due to the parallel processing. So if you&amp;rsquo;re doing something serious, you have no other choice besides CUDA as of writing. Although, OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s Triton and ZLUDA are worth keeping an eye on.
Unlike your average distro, Nix will store its packages and libraries (derivations) in the Nix store instead of locations like /usr/bin, /usr/lib and /usr/lib64.</description></item><item><title>The Make Everything Ok Button</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/the-make-everything-ok-button/</link><pubDate>Sun, 09 Oct 2022 09:20:30 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/the-make-everything-ok-button/</guid><description>Disclaimer Before I begin, I must warn you that DeepFaceLab is just a tool, neither good nor evil. Neither Deepfacelab nor the docker image is meant for generating illicit or obscene imagery. You shall be solely liable for anything you do with these tools.
You know the drill Everytime I have to install DeepFaceLab on any of my systems, it comes with a lot of hassle mostly due to incompatibilities between the GPU libraries and Python versions.</description></item></channel></rss>
