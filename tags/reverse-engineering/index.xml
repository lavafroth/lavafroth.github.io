As every year, I&amp;rsquo;ll begin this one with sharing my writeup for the 2023 Holiday Hack Challenge for Kringlecon. I must warn you that this is an incomplete writeup, I had been unable to finish all the challenges due to other important events in life.
With that out of the way, enjoy the writeup!
Christmas Island: Orientation Cranberry Pi answer
Christmas Island: Frosty&amp;rsquo;s Beach Snowball Fight We begin with a small snowball fight mini-game called Santa&amp;rsquo;s Snowball Hero where we can either team up with a random player to fight against santa or play in a private room.</description></item><item><title>Headache</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/headache-reverse-engineering-amateursctf-2023/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Sep 2023 07:03:27 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/headache-reverse-engineering-amateursctf-2023/</guid><description>This challenge involves reverse engineering a polymorphic binary, one that modifies its own instructions during runtime.
Essentially, the binary checks if the current character equals a known value and xor decrypts the next section where the code jumps to. If the characters don&amp;rsquo;t match, the logic short-circuits and the program exits.
This process of checking the character and decrypting the next branch continues like opening up a Matryoshka doll until the last branch which returns instead of calling the decryption subroutine.</description></item><item><title>Volcano</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/volcano-reverse-engineering-amateursctf-2023/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jul 2023 18:29:59 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/volcano-reverse-engineering-amateursctf-2023/</guid><description>This reversing challenge is very mathematical, focusing mainly on modulo congruences. Like all challenges, there is some scary looking obfuscation for the fun which I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to explain. The challenge description says that it was inspired by recent &amp;ldquo;traumatic&amp;rdquo; events but I&amp;rsquo;m oblivious to what that reference meant.
Decompilation We start off with downloading the binary and opening it in Ghidra.
In the list of functions under the Symbol Tree, we can navigate to the entry function which looks like:</description></item><item><title>Java Script Kiddie 2</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/picoctf-web-java-script-kiddie-2/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 09:47:54 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/picoctf-web-java-script-kiddie-2/</guid><description>The challenge This is a web challenge involving javascript, meaning most of the solution is going to be client side. We are asked to visit the challenge page.
From here, we can view the source code of the page.
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt; &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;jquery-3.3.1.min.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script&amp;gt; var bytes = []; $.get(&amp;#34;bytes&amp;#34;, function(resp) { bytes = Array.from(resp.split(&amp;#34; &amp;#34;), x =&amp;gt; Number(x)); }); function assemble_png(u_in){ var LEN = 16; var key = &amp;#34;00000000000000000000000000000000&amp;#34;; var shifter; if(u_in.</description></item><item><title>Some Assembly Required 3</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/picoctf-web-some-assembly-required-3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 16:39:08 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/picoctf-web-some-assembly-required-3/</guid><description>This is a web exploitation challenge from 2021. It&amp;rsquo;s pretty old but has less solves as of writing this post. I figured, it&amp;rsquo;s worth talking about.
We are told to visit http://mercury.picoctf.net:60022/index.html where we find a simple textbox prompting us to submit the flag.
Looking at the page source by pressing ctrl u, we see that it is sourcing javascript code from rTEuOmSfG3.js.
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;rTEuOmSfG3.js&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; While examining the javascript, we will notice that it is obfuscated and packed.</description></item><item><title>Kringlecon 2022 Writeup</title><link>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/kringlecon-2022-writeup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2023 10:36:35 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://lavafroth.is-a.dev/post/kringlecon-2022-writeup/</guid><description>This writeup is rather haphazard as I jumped around from one place to another solving different unrelated challenges. Although the writeup covers all the challenges, it definitely is not sequential. Just wanted to point that out before diving in.
Clone with a Difference This challenge wants us to clone a git repository. It&amp;rsquo;s using git with ssh for cloning which doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to work.
git clone git@haugfactory.com:asnowball/aws_scripts.git We can clone this the HTTPS way:</description></item></channel></rss>
